  1. BE SURE TO FORK!
2. Add your appid above

  2. speedHack() is called when the "call" button is clicked
  3. Start a call with the endpoint specified by friendId (which is set for you)
  4. This smaple app contains onConnect() and onLocalMedia() helper funtions you may wish to use
  5. ***BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR FORK'D CODEPEN***
4. Send us a chat message with your codepen URL using http://respoke-messaging.herokuapp.com/
5. Accept the video call and tell us what you want to use Respoke for

You can either modify the fork'd codepen or modify the code locally and then copy/paste into codepen to do the video call

If you run the static files locally, here is an option for serving them:

    $   npm install -g http-server

then from the directory run

    $   http-server
