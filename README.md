  1. BE SURE TO FORK!
2. Add your appid above
3. Implement the speedHack() function per these notes:
  1. Docs here may help: https://docs.respoke.io/js-library/respoke.Client.html#startCall
  2. speedHack() is called when the "call" button is clicked
  3. Start a call with the endpoint specified by friendId (which is set for you)
  4. This smaple app contains onConnect() and onLocalMedia() helper funtions you may wish to use
  5. ***BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR FORK'D CODEPEN***
4. Send respoke\_judge a message on freenode IRC with your codepen URL. You can use http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=apistrat or any IRC client connected to freenode/#apistrat.
5. We'll call you on your app! Accept the video call by clicking 'allow' and tell us what you want to use Respoke for.

You can either modify the fork'd codepen or modify the code locally and then copy/paste into codepen to do the video call

If you run the static files locally, here is an option for serving them:

    $   npm install -g http-server

then from the directory run

    $   http-server
