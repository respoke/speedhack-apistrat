Welcome to the speed hack challenge

Your mission:

1. Add your appid above
2. Finsh the speedHack() function
3. Send us a chat message with your codepen URL using http://respoke-messaging.herokuapp.com/
4. Accept the video call and tell us what you want to use Respoke for

Notes:

- speedHack() is called when the "call" button is clicked
- Start a call with the endpoint specified by the friendID variable
- The onConnect() and onLocalVideo() helper callbacks are available to you to attach video to the UI
- Docs here may help: https://docs.respoke.io/js-library/respoke.Client.html#startCall
- Go! 

A codepen is available here with this sample code:
http://codepen.io/Respoke/pen/BdlHK/left/?editors=001

You can either modify the codepen or modify locally and then copy/paste into codepen to do the video call

If you run the static locally, here is an option for serving it: 

    $   npm install -g http-server

then from the directory run

    $   http-server
